In this project, we create a model that will use data such as an image, age, and sex of a patient to diagnose the patient's skin anomaly as benign or malignant.

The model created achieved a specificity of 0.96 and a sensitivity of 0.52.

This means that the model was able to only correctly diagnose 52% of the people who had the disease, this is near the expected outcome of guessing. However, the model manages to correctly diagnose 96% of the people who did not have the disease. 

This suggests that the model is very effective at ruling in patients. That is, if the model states that a patient has the disease, then we should rule in the diagnoses of the anomaly being malignant.
